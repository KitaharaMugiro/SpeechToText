 Yeah, what was the name of the company y combinator y combinator. Yeah, so I assume it's a common word in the lair. Yep. Yep. Cool. Cool. So you've got a big conference about accelerators in December? Mmm. That's right. Are you hosting the entire conference? Yes, that's right. So yes, we are I am owner.

 Invite, we invite other other speak speaker. Hmm. I got you cool. Cool. Yep, great. That's exciting. Yep. That sounds like a lot of fun but very nervously. Oh, yeah is this is this the first conference you've done? No sometime.
 Easy you've done it before. Yeah, you're used to it. So we have to prepare the perfect story. Hmm So today, we're only doing 40 minutes. Yeah. This is my understanding. Yep. So we want to focus a little more get some work done. We're going to do the third interview question, which was telling me about
 A time you had a conflict or a challenge.
 In work something in the past and tell me how you overcame what the judge did you prepare that topic at all try to challenge. We talked about it a bit last class. Did you prepare at all? Do you remember at the end of last class? I mentioned it and you said you would think you would prepare.
 Did you?
 Do you understand prepare did you prepare would be honest then. Did you prepare that answer? Oh, sorry. No social now. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I'm not upset. I just - it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. We're going to work through it together what we want to focus on.
 Is of course our previous points, right? So on day one we talked about l&r improving a lot we talked about less. So it's also and more and and in last week we talked about ing phrases, right? So
 my what is your job my job is
 what can you say or what is an accelerator? What is an accelerator do so invested invest invest in start-up and provide education mentoring or office created so you can actually say my job is investing in startups and providing.
 Oh you mean that I have to
 After say England I energy for big big noun phrases instead of my job is startups. My job is investing in startups. Okay in this case is a high energy is none now hmm, okay investing in startups and providing education and office. Yep. That sounds really good. Okay, let you make really
 Lee complex sentences, we also talked a bit about intonation. Sometimes you rise to much. So let's let's just quick review that clotting.
 Let's stay screen share.

 Mmm, I'll read it once I have both experience with working in large corporations and working in startups. I have both experienced with the walking in large corporations and the walking in startups good so it's really important is that this section goes down duh, both exposures a week walking in large corporation and what?
 In the startup. Yeah, when you're done with your sentence, you want to come down? Hold on? Okay, cool. So that's a review of our previous points. Today. We're going to be talking about your past a problem. You had a challenge you had so we want to think about how we use the past or we talk about the past. We use past language. I think your simple past is pretty good. So for example you
 I often say things like asked and told started. So this is good you I think you do a good job of simple past. But sometimes past is a little bit difficult, especially when we have like a nested phrase.
 for example
 I think


 I don't know Sushi is good. See how Sushi is good is kind of nested in I think.
 What did not not missed it missed it nested means like inside.
 like layers
 Hmm. How do you explain that?
 Knit it mean wrapped.
 Do you understand wrapped left rap left? Yeah.
 Rap is okay left is to mean the sorry Mister. Yeah nest of a bird as good as a phrase by itself.
 But then we Nest that inside another sentence. I think that
 and you can Nest that inside another sentence saying I get gay he said that
 Something right in rap. Yeah, he's get do I have to use that that is optional optional. Yeah better. So do I have to use use or not use? I think she's he said he said he thinks she's good. He said that it's fine. Both are fine. Well, yeah. Yeah that sometimes that helps.
 Make it clear. We're all really complex sentences The Listener gets confused. You know, what's rapping what and that makes it easier to understand you mean I using a duck is a more career. It's more clear for complex sentences because sometimes you have this
 Is this phrase wrapped in this phrase wrapped in this raised and that's being pointed at by this phrase and it's like what's what's what it's very confusing. All right, so that's that can help make it clear. Okay on this thing. Anyway, this can get a little bit difficult when we're talking about the past.
 For example an employee asked me for a raise and I told him and this is what you were going to tell him.

 What do we have to change to put it right here?
 And then breathe ask me for eight nothing for asking for a raise.
 What do we have to change here?

 I told of the okay I gave him a raise.
 King I will gave I gay
 except you told him this is where it gets tricky.
 Over here. How about this one?
 This one's easy. What should that be? Whoa, yeah works. Okay. Good job. Good job.
 Yep, this is a little bit trickier is a little difficult.
 I can read I have to change this word.
 Change not give we change will.
 No change we do change but we don't change give we change will.
 ha
 I do not know mmm.
 I would give him a red. This is what we want to look at today.
 And I started my own company. I thought I can turn a profit within two years. So what can we do here?
 I couldn't it. Mmm. Good job. Could on the Proviso is to you. Yep Sonia maybe you didn't maybe you couldn't but you thought I could I could I thought I could I thought I could yeah. Yeah, so the the reason we're doing this is because the the
 The the thought is I can do it in the future what you told him is I will give you a raise in the future but this thought and this statement are in the past. Okay. Hmm if you had said
 And I told him I gave him a raise.

 You already gave him one.
 You already why is he asking about it?
 That doesn't make sense. Right an employee asked me for a raise and I told him I gave him a raise and he plays like you gave me a raise. No, I want to raise him.
 See how that doesn't make sense.
 It does not this does not make sense. If I already gave him either make sense if you already gave him one, but if you're even 1yz asking maybe maybe maybe okay, okay.
 So would and could these are very difficult words to that. These two words are one of the hardest parts of English, I think but start thinking about it when you are talking about the past there are many opportunities to use wood and good. Okay. Okay understand cool. Let's
 Keep in mind many things Ln our intonation, but also this and let's try question number three. Tell me about a time you faced a challenge or had a conflict cooperate in past in the past. Tell me what happened and how you solved it.
 Okay. Okay, Kofi. Kingston Trends. Yeah. Okay. So a fan I started my company I conflicted with one stock order.
 hungry
 Yeah, so he so a problem happened at the time just the stockholder was angry very much. So he what do you mean a program happened program program program, so

 So so program quality program that program now so trouble trouble trouble. We had a problem problem problem. Just so we're clear I thought
 It sounded to me like you said program row Graham problem.
 Problem problem. Hmm Bloom program. Hmm. Don't don't go blam. Just Bloom room problem problem. Robert Levin joined the program. Hmm overall problem Ron nice program through Millennia giant program. Hmm. Yeah, so there was a problem.
 Bro, bro, so we had the big big problem. Hmm.

 Mmm Yeah, so so we could we could not control him.
 Control vo him and he invested in your company. So
 it's kind of like he's a client. No, not an employee is part of owner or is more of an owner. Okay is an owner although over on investing us but not an employee. You can't give him orders but no employee. Hmm. He was a wonderful Rona. Hmm. Yeah, so it is it was very difficult.
 Yeah, so we could not match the paint our opinion. Hmm. Yeah, so he was angry very much. Hmm. We couldn't mmm go on go on, but and I wanted to
 This door opener under so take take we want. I wanted to take his share. Mmm again mmm, but he didn't he did not accept. Hmm. So he was very angry.
 So it was very very big problem.
 Hmm, so I was buried disappointed and I was very tired.
 To overcome this problem. Mmm. Yeah. Mmm and the man how did you feel? Oh, very nervous and sad and very tired and our company at that time. Our company could not get enough profit.

 yep, so very very tired and
 Yeah, did you have a plan to handle the stockholder or handle your profits? What was your plan to solve the problem so program? Yeah, we just have to
 Communicate with this person that person hmm, but tell him what yeah, they're here. Tell him about our solution. Hmm But
 he did he didn't meet us.
 He didn't meet meet us. He didn't make make a meeting with me. Oh, he refused to cough you to meet me refused. We do you think Hmm he live he used to meet me. Hmm. Yeah.
 Okay, I could not.
 Saurabh them this program. Mmm. So one day he so I'm curious. I just want to get some better language in here. What did you ask him? You contacted him? And you asked him.
 So yeah, I want it to meet him. So we meet up. Please make maker.
 I asked him.
 I start the I asked him I asked I asked him I asked him meeting me me up if if he if he if he even he I asked him that.
 Who him we have we have we had a meet mirroring.
 Hmm. We have to make me committing Hmm. This is a perfect example of the point we talked about today.
 Let's ignore all this other stuff resuming in right here we all get we had a mini.
 I asked him.

 We what do you normally ask someone?
 I will ask him.
 if he
 what do you think?
 This is future future. He present tense present or future even accept if he future actually jump wait, well, I'll say oops my

 Except my sorry regressed Hmm. This world requesting. Oh, yeah, yeah or else we'll make it simple use the language above if he will have a meeting obviously if he will meet with me.
 So, how do we get that up here?
 Bureau is the better. Yeah, but how do we make it past tense this also I thought now I told told to the Past thing. Hmm. So we have do I have to use a will? We're not well, what do we want?

 buses
 Okay famous questionable.
 So what do we want here?
 We want this but past tense of this process.
 Where were good score?
 You had several good codes, by the way, great great use of could we couldn't do this? I couldn't do that. He meant with me.
 Okay, okay. Okay chocolate. So in the past so future so possibly try it. That's the actual name by the way. Okay and English teaching they call it future in the past in the past. I had this then this is the actual name of God.
 Go get awesome. I asked him if he would meet with me. Hmm. Let's look at a couple other sentences you had.

 When I started my company, I conflicted one stockholder. I think this is what you said.
 here

 We with good good good go all the way to a stop order and maybe had a conflict is better. Oh, really? Yeah, I think this sounds better awesome book about how the conflict with the won't stop order. We could not much opinion. This is one. I think you do a lot by the way.

 Look at not misuse of match. You're probably thinking I was said or something meet you so much. We don't use match like this in English. Oh am I? Yeah, I'm and II would say to we don't really use match like that. What do we say when someone two people have the same opinions?
 Three disa Sokka, we could not agree. Mmm opinion only we agree with each other with it was your night.
 I could not agree with each other.
 Or on an issue an issue on a topic of game on us easy. Yeah.
 On our opinions, I guess and it's a little weird. I agree. I agree is good enough. We could not agree. Although we could not agree. Hmm. Yeah, so maybe this is kind of like so just used it less match. That's don't use try don't use match against the man. I wanted to take his share again, but he did not accept.
 Hi Mother, Stan Lee. I wanted to sorry lead by another three by yeah, I like that guy read by do we say read by Maybe by back by then? Hmm buy back his chair again. Hmm again tonight. Maybe I could share again. Yeah, I guess not again, right?
 Right. Yeah good catch good catch share. Here's an may be a good example. He did not accept his okay.
 Did you ask multiple times?
 Multiple, how did multiple men?
 But that mode every week you asked can I buy back your shoes not know actually. Maybe this is another opportunity to do a form like this. So rather not just I did it. I wanted it happened. But instead I thought I asked I said.
 Okay, Ahsoka I said I said to him to buy back.
 To I said maybe told I told him I told him.
 To buy back. I told him.
 I would want want to hmm would want maybe would like I would like to.
 Buy back his chair notice. We get a whole sentence in here. Right? We say I again I told him I would like like to buy back his chair.
 He could not accept an excellent. Those are both so good Mmm Yeah. Okay, so it is very deep got the idea.
 I I don't use I don't get used to use a put the net. Mmm-hmm. Okay, I would like to buy back his chair. But him I said it would not would not accept. Hmm. Okay, okay.
 Also the pronunciation he would would not accept not good would would would make sure that W is really whoa. Ah, he will not accept with. Yeah. I told him I would really like to buy back his chair, but he would not accept.
 Great with that. Okay, we're running out of time. But I want to do a quick review of the answer. Try to keep it short and clean right when I started my company. There was this guy
 we had trouble with our profits. I wanted I told him I would like to buy his shares. He would not accept so keep it short direct. Okay, so quick tell me about a time when you had a conflict and how you solved it. Now. We'll go. Ok. So playing that piano was when I started my
 Own company. Hmm. I have I had a conflict with one stop order we so we have we had a big program and aye aye.
 I wanted to live by his his stop order stop share, but he put us he would he would not accept it. Yeah, and
 Yo, so I I asked I asked him.
 That that we had we had a Miriam each other Mmm Yeah, but I he'll only fused with you would leave you.
 To meet meet meet meet me. Yeah, he would so I spent I spent I spent about
 Well on the half-year to solve this problem. Hmm, so I was buried I was very tired and I was very very stressed every day every day. Yes. Yes, and I in at that time, I we could not enough profit. Yeah, so
 it is very thick. It was very severe. We could not what enough profit well known. Otherwise, we could not turn. So. Yes, we could not enough profit verb.
 We could not verb enough profit on the enough profit thing. So Barry Barry.
 Great. I think that was a pretty good answer. No ideally.
 Maybe a little more explanation about how you solved it after or what happened in the end the results.
 But good answer the language was much better than the first time. Yeah. Thank you. How did you feel about?
 Not yeah. Yeah your response now the language okay. Hmm and could very difficult words for Japanese. I I didn't I don't use usually use this work this work. Hmm and in Japanese language Japanese language, that doesn't have
 How to use like how to use it and could doesn't have words similar Universe. We don't use here. Yeah what I'm good. Yeah, like perfect tense. Yeah, perfect 10 to 1. Yeah, what includes difficult though? I think the this is half of the difficulty with wouldn't cut if you can get the future in the past.
 Future in the past right? It's like forward but past. Yeah, if you can master that like 50% there the other 50. Oops. Sorry, the other 50% is imagining, you know, in five years if my company is more successful. I would like to and this is imagining a future. That's the other.
 Other half of wooden could so future in the past and imagining and next week. We're going to do some future stuff. I believe it's where do you see yourself in 5 years 5 years. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, yep. I will prepare prepare their next next topic think about
 Incurred would and could think about how you can use them again? Okay. All right. It was great talking to you again know if you eat so much. Yeah, so I'll see you next week. Yes. Goodnight. Goodnight or good morning. Have a nice day. Bye.
